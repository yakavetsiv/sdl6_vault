Accelerating the discovery of new molecules and materials, as well as
developing green and sustainable ways to synthesize them, will help to
address global challenges in energy, sustainability and healthcare. The
recent growth of data science and automated experimentation techniques
has resulted in the advent of self-driving labs (SDLs) via the integration
of machine learning, lab automation and robotics. An SDL is a machine-
learning-assisted modular experimental platform that iteratively operates
a series of experiments selected by the machine learning algorithm to
achieve a user-defined objective. These intelligent robotic assistants
help researchers to accelerate the pace of fundamental and applied
research through rapid exploration of the chemical space. In this Review,
we introduce SDLs and provide a roadmap for their implementation
by non-expert scientists. We present the status quo of successful SDL
implementations in the field and discuss their current limitations and future
opportunities to accelerate finding solutions for societal needs.

Finding tangible solutions for global challenges in energy, sustain-
ability and healthcare is the cornerstone of the research, economic
and societal activities; however, the current strategies to address
these challenges are time, resource and labour intensive. From the
first practical demonstration of a silicon solar cell in 1954, it took more
than half a century to find a more cost-effective material than silicon,
and yet it is not deployed at scale1. The timeframe of drug discovery
and development is typically ten years, with a cost of more than US$1
billion (ref. 2). Despite the worldwide acknowledgement of climate
change and environmental pollution with plastics more than 20 years
ago3,4, currently there is no scalable technological solution for effective
carbon capture and seawater treatment. These examples share a com-
mon challenge: the need to explore a vast number of continuous and
discrete experimental variables to find the most effective composition
as well as manufacturing routes of molecules and materials. Current
exploration strategies in chemical and materials sciences rely on prior
knowledge and, experimentally, on changing variables one at a time
or in a combinatorial fashion. Despite the straightforward nature of
these approaches, they do not meet the required pace of discovery
in chemical and materials sciences to address the global challenges

in energy, sustainability and healthcare5. Although initially highly
promising, combinatorial screening strategies did not make a major
breakthrough in the fields of energy materials or small molecules, due
to the exponential growth of the number of required experiments with
every added experimental variable.

In addition, the slow progress in chemical space exploration is
attributed to: 1) the physical disconnection between the stages of syn-
thesis, characterization and performance evaluation in a conventional
chemistry and materials science lab, as well as (2) the time gap between
performing an experiment and making a decision about the conditions
of the next experiment(s) to find a new compound or material with
the targeted properties, identify an optimized synthetic route for an
existing compound or unveil the underlying mechanism of a complex
reaction. The physical disconnection refers to the siloed nature of the
conventional research efforts on the discovery of new materials and
molecules. Finding innovative solutions for large-scale global problems
requires an interdisciplinary approach to experimental chemical and
materials science. The siloed format of conventional chemistry and
materials science labs slows down the very much required interdisci-
plinary research. For example, in the conventional experimental efforts

on the discovery of clean energy technologies, different research
groups study materials and develop devices. Materials scientists and
device engineers typically work separately on different aspects of
clean energy technologies. As a result, solution-processable clean
energy materials are being sought after without considering their
specific requirements at the device level, and device architectures
are being optimized without the best-performing material at hand.
In addition, this disconnection of the material synthesis and device-
level integration results in an inefficient research operation without
taking advantage of intermediate information (materials properties).
These limitations stem from the current human-dependent approach
to research in every step of an experimental workflow. The COVID-19
pandemic exposed the strong reliance on ‘in person’ presence for
conventional experimental research, and the laboratory shutdowns
led researchers to think about their approach to experimental research
in academic and industrial settings6.

The vast size and high dimensionality (dimension refers here to a
continuous or discrete experimental variable) of the chemical design
spaces that need to be experimentally explored require new integrated
strategies to accelerate the discovery of new molecules and advanced
functional materials, as well as to find sustainable ways for their scaled-
up synthesis and manufacturing.

Recent advances in robotics7,8 and artificial intelligence9,10 offer an
exciting opportunity to reshape research in the experimental chemical
and materials sciences. Artificial intelligence, a subfield of computer
science, seeks to build machines with human-programmed intelligence
(for example, the ability of decision-making). Machine learning (ML), a
subfield of artificial intelligence, seeks to build mathematical models
for complex tasks and processes with high-dimensional spaces to per-
form automated operations, such as the prediction of a synthesis out-
come or material properties or image classification. The convergence
of ML, lab automation (for example, synthesis, separation, purification
and characterization) and robotics (for example, reagent preparation
and sample transfer between different experimental modules) led to
the development of ‘self-driving labs’ (SDLs)11. SDLs leverage scientific
and technological advancements made in academia and industry over
the past decade in lab automation12–14, reaction miniaturization (via flow
chemistry and microfluidics)15 and online analytical characterization16.
In contrast to human-dependent experimental settings in conventional
chemistry and materials science labs (Fig. 1a), the SDLs (Fig. 1b) use: (1)
robots to operate multiple repetitive tasks that are time-consuming,
require precision or pose safety concerns when dealing with toxic or
flammable chemicals, and (2) computers that can outperform human
scientists for certain tasks, such as handling high-dimensional big data.
In this manner, the use of SDLs addresses three challenges of conven-
tional chemistry and materials science labs: (1) inefficient and slow
experimental space exploration, (2) physical disconnection between
different experimental stages and (3) the time gap between performing
an experiment and selecting the next experiment to be tested.

By the robotic integration of experimental modules, SDLs connect
the otherwise physically disconnected stages of reagent preparation,
synthesis, characterization and performance evaluation to establish
an end-to-end experimental workflow for an accelerated synthesis and
development of new molecules and materials. The end-to-end nature of
SDLs17 becomes extremely powerful to co-design materials and devices.
For example, the co-design of clean energy materials and devices within
an SDL equipped with the material synthesis, purification, processing
and device integration modules enables another research acceleration
opportunity beyond the siloed operation of SDLs only focused on the
synthesis or processing aspects of materials.

Importantly, the use of SDLs can avail a substantial amount of
the researcher’s time to focus on new conceptual or intellectual chal-
lenges, rather than on time-consuming repetitive tasks in the lab.
Instead of changing one variable at a time, by incorporating ML, SDLs
intelligently explore the chemical space and at the same time minimize
or eliminate the time gap between acquiring experimental results and
decision-making for the conditions of the next experiment. In contrast
to the frequently misinterpreted purpose of SDLs (replacing highly
trained scientists in research settings), intelligent robotic assistants
are meant to accelerate discovery and avail the time of chemists and
materials scientists to high-level scientific questions. For example,
providing an SDL with a research acceleration of 10 times (Fig. 1b) for
each of the researchers shown in Fig. 1a increases their overall research
productivity by at least 30 times, which allows them to work on new
scientific questions. As a result, SDLs reshape the role of the operator
and/or researcher in the chemical and materials science workflow
(Fig. 1b). Intelligent experimental planning and autonomous explo-
ration of the experimental space allow scientists to see a big picture
of the scientific problem, discard unfavourable synthetic routes and
effectively identify impactful intrinsic and extrinsic experimental
variables that control the targeted physicochemical properties of
molecules or materials.

Over the past decade, promising applications of SDLs were dem-
onstrated to accelerate the synthesis and fabrication of molecules
and materials, for example, carbon nanotubes18, complex organic
compounds13,19–21, nanomaterials22–27, phase-change memory materials28
and thin-film materials29,30. Yet, the SDL utility in chemical and materials
sciences is still limited. The reasons for the slow progress of SDLs are
the lack of: (1) standardized and cost-effective hardware, (2) readily
accessible software, (3) user-friendly operational guidelines for chem-
ists and materials scientists and (4) the incorporation of physics-based
models with autonomous experimentation.

This Review introduces SDLs for experimental chemistry and
materials science and highlights recent successful examples for the
autonomous synthesis of organic molecules and functional (nano)
materials. It provides a roadmap for starting an SDL in a conventional
chemistry and materials science lab and discusses the steps toward its
successful implementation. The discussion of current limitations and

chemical and materials sciences to accelerate the implementation of
this new integrated workflow in their experimental research, and for
industry to focus on the standardization of SDL hardware and software
for their broad deployment to accelerate the synthesis of new com-
pounds and the development of advanced materials that contribute
to scalable future technological solutions.

SDLs in chemical and materials sciences
An SDL is an intelligent experimental platform equipped with differ-
ent hardware modules that iteratively operate a series of syntheses
or physical processes selected and planned by the ML algorithm in
a closed-loop format to achieve a predefined objective. The SDL’s
closed-loop operation refers to the cycle of performing an ML-selected
experiment by following an automated series of tasks, acquiring exper-
imental data, updating an ML model and making a decision about the
next set of experimental conditions to be tested by the SDL. Examples
of tasks performed by the modules include reagent preparation, mix-
ing, synthesis, purification, printing and characterization. An SDL
operator defines the closed-loop ‘campaign’ objective, for example,
to identify a new compound with the desired properties, accelerated
retrosynthesis of an existing compound or low-temperature manu-
facturing of a thin-film material. In addition, the SDL operator can
leverage the prior domain knowledge and human expertise, such as
physics-based models (for example, conservation laws) and an initial
hypothesis (for example, about the reaction mechanism), as well as
constrains of the reaction conditions, such as the range of tempera-
tures, pressures and reagent concentrations. In this sense, SDLs act as
an assistant to scientists in the discovery, exploration, optimization
and/or synthesis–structure–property mapping of new molecules and
advanced materials. Furthermore, SDLs enable access to unexplored
regions of the experimental design space and accelerate the pace of
research towards novel compounds. With intelligent experimental
planning, big data generated by SDLs can rapidly provide important
information about the underlying reaction mechanisms of complex
multistage reactions.

Figure 2 illustrates recent implementation of SDLs in chemical
and materials sciences. For example, SDLs enabled closed-loop synthe-
sis–property relationship mapping (Fig. 2a) and on-demand synthesis
(Fig. 2b) of semiconductor22,23,26,31–33 and metal24,25,34 nanoparticles
>1,000 times faster than conventional techniques. Chiral metal halide
perovskite nanoparticles were revealed by an SDL with 250 autono-
mously selected and performed experiments (Fig. 2c). Furthermore,
the use of SDLs accelerated the discovery of semiconductor and metal
thin-film compositions29,30,35 and their low-temperature processing
conditions, 50 °C lower than that of prior art (Fig. 2d)30. An eight-day
continuous and unattended operation of an SDL (688 experiments)
unveiled an effective photocatalyst formulation for hydrogen evolu-
tion from water six times more active than that of prior art (Fig. 2e)21.
The data-driven operation of an SDL reduced the total number of
experiments required to identify a high-performing three-dimensional-
printed structure with maximum toughness by 60-fold compared with
a conventional grid search (Fig. 2f)36. In addition to the examples listed,
SDLs were recently utilized for the on-demand and on-site manufactur-
ing of active pharmaceutical ingredients13,19,20.

The main impact of SDLs is the ‘research acceleration’ to gener-
ate new knowledge that leads to the discovery of novel compounds
or manufacturing routes of the best-performing materials 10–1,000
times faster than by utilizing one-at-a-time variable exploration or
combinatorial experiments. The acceleration factor directly trans-
lates into a substantial reduction in research time, cost, resources,
waste and carbon footprint in academia and industry. We believe
that  the  accelerated  finding  of  innovative  solutions  to  global
problems will be the most impactful contribution of SDLs in the
next decade.

A roadmap for SDLs
The most common questions asked by a scientist considering the
adoption of an SDL in the chemical or materials science research are,
‘Where should I start?’, ‘What ML algorithms can be used for experiment-
selection and data mining?’, ‘How long does it take to build an SDL?’
and ‘What would be the cost of building an SDL?’. The answers to these
questions are directly related to the type of molecules or materials to
be prepared and the goal of research, for example, discovery, explora-
tion, mechanistic study or optimization. Figure 3a presents a general
roadmap for SDLs, aimed at answering the question ‘Where should I
start?’. From the hardware perspective, the targeted class of molecules
or materials determines the selection of the required SDL hardware
modules by specifying the reagents and the type of reaction (that is,
gas, liquid or solid phase), as well as the necessary characterization
techniques. From the software perspective, the goal of an SDL operation
also determines the scope of the intelligent experiment planning and
the required software components for the SDL’s closed-loop campaigns.
As shown in Fig. 3a, a modular approach to the implementation of
an SDL in a conventional chemistry or materials science lab includes
the selection and integration of hardware and software modules to cre-
ate the experimental design that is best suited for the targeted class of
molecules or materials. The preparation of reagents involves robotic
handling, stirring, heating and degassing of liquids and/or solids.
Depending on the nature of the reaction, miniaturized flow reactors,
parallel batch reactors or glass and/or silicon substrates (thin-film
materials) are utilized for the automated synthesis under conditions
selected by the ML algorithm (software). The purification module of
the SDL hardware can include solvent removal (for organic synthesis),
centrifugation (for nanomaterial synthesis) or spin coating (for thin-
film preparation). The processing module includes the evaluation of
the physical or chemical performance of the autonomously produced
molecules or materials, for example, their photostability, conductiv-
ity or reactivity. Examples of the SDL processing modules include
the coating and printing of thin films and nanocrystal inks, bioactiv-
ity of active pharmaceutical ingredients in medicinal chemistry and
turnover frequency in (photo)catalysis. The characterization module
is critically important for the evaluation of the properties of molecules
and materials produced in the SDL after each module. The analytical
techniques that have already been implemented in SDLs for organic
synthesis include high-performance liquid chromatography and gas
chromatography, mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy.
Characterization techniques integrated with SDLs for the autonomous
development of nanomaterials and thin films include ultraviolet–vis-
ible–near infrared absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopy.
When a characterization technique is difficult to dedicate to a specific
SDL due to the cost (for example, X-ray diffraction spectroscopy), com-
plicated sample preparation (for example, transmission and scanning
electron microscopy) or inaccessibility in the SDL location (for exam-
ple, a synchrotron light source), ML-assisted parameter space explora-
tion is accomplished at a slower pace than that of a fully autonomous
robotic experimentation, as it requires a manual sample preparation
and characterization by an operator37. In this format, the lack of robotic
automation of one or a few experimental steps will lower the overall
research throughput compared with that of a fully autonomous robotic
experimentation format, but the ML-assisted experiment selection
will still make it considerably faster than the conventional exploration
strategies in chemical and materials sciences.

As illustrated in Fig. 3a, sample transfer between different modules
of an SDL can be handled by stationary26,29,30,36 or mobile21 robots or
using pumps, valves and tubing13,20,22,23,25. When dealing with air- and/
or moisture-sensitive chemical compounds, placing the SDL under an
inert atmosphere can improve sample handling and data reproduc-
ibility. When the characterization module is integrated online with the
synthesis module, the reaction sampling can be conducted by using

valves and pumps13,20 without the need for the robotic arm. If the char-
acterization technique cannot be directly integrated with the synthesis
module, but can be placed within a close proximity of the synthesis
module, a stationary robotic arm can transfer the sample between the
synthesis and characterization modules of the SDL26,29,30,36. When the
characterization module cannot be placed within reach of a stationary
robotic arm, a mobile robotic arm can perform the sample transfer
across the SDL21. The configurations of the SDLs with fluidic sample
transfer and a stationary robotic arm require custom-development
and specific integration of the characterization modules with the
synthesis module of the SDLs, whereas mobile robots are a retrofit to
the conventional chemistry and materials science labs. Robotic arms,
in addition to sample transfer, can also be utilized for autonomous
reconfiguration of the end-to-end modular workflow from the starting
reagents to the final purified product, which substantially expands
the SDL’s capabilities to explore continuous and discrete variables
and enable access to a larger portion of the design space than that of
conventional experimental platforms.

From the software perspective, data flow between different SDL
modules serves as a key point for closed-loop operations38,39. Reliable
data flow using robust data representation and metadata tracking
strategy, that is, recording and reporting the latent features of each
experiment, is required to truly digitize the synthesis and manufac-
turing of molecules and materials with scalable and transferrable
knowledge. An accelerated discovery will only become possible when
standardized and reliable digital data of all the reactions tested by
SDLs become readily available. Equipping SDLs with standardized
data representation and access to the metadata of prior experiments
performed on the same or different SDLs will address the common
challenge of lab-to-lab variations (or irreproducibility) that is faced in
the synthesis of functional materials and complex organic compounds.
SDLs incorporate ML for modelling and the uncertainty quan-
tification of experimental data or genetic algorithms to efficiently
explore the synthesis design space of molecules or (nano)materials in
a sequential, closed-loop and adaptive manner40–42. This critical adap-
tive aspect of autonomous experimentation leverages the uncertainty

quantification of data-driven ML models to overcome the limitations
of non-adaptive combinatorial screening techniques. Closed-loop
formulation–synthesis–structure–property mapping of the targeted
class of molecules or materials can be performed by using genetic
algorithms or by integrating an ML model (thus improving the model
prediction accuracy with every new data point) of single or multiple
experimental objectives, for example, reaction yield and regioselectiv-
ity or film thickness and manufacturing temperature with uncertainty
quantification. The uncertainty quantification of ML models can be
utilized to select the next experimental condition by using exploration
(design space navigation), exploitation (optimization) or balanced
exploration–exploitation decision policies. Existing open-access SDL
software packages, which include ChemOS43 and ARES OS44, provide a
user-friendly starting point for researchers in chemical and materials
sciences to initiate an autonomous experimentation. The closed-loop
operation of SDLs can be utilized for fundamental studies, for example,
to uncover reaction mechanisms, as well as in applied research, for
example, the identification of the most sustainable manufacturing
route of the target molecule or material. Using ML algorithms that are
not properly selected, designed or tuned to achieve a specific objective

of the SDL operation substantially increases the number of closed-loop
experimental iterations and, hence, the total cost of experiments42.
This is why comparing the suitability of ML algorithms for different
classes of molecules and (nano)materials45 by using freely accessible
and reproducible data libraries is a vitally important feature of the
future developments of SDLs. Providing open-access ML benchmarking
resources will be crucial to answer the question ‘What ML algorithms
can be used for experiment selection and data mining?’.

The answers to questions ‘How long does it take to build an SDL?’
and ‘What would be the cost of building an SDL?’ are directly related
to the complexity of the required experimental modules (for example,
single versus multistage experimental stages), the range and number of
operating process conditions (for example, pressure and temperature),
type of solvent (aqueous versus organic), required characterization
technique(s) and acceptable precision. Building a reliable SDL with
a high level of reproducibility for chemistry and materials science
labs can take from several weeks to 1–2 years and cost from less than
US$1,000 to more than US$1,000,000. For example, the hardware and
software requirements of an SDL that performs at room-temperature
with a colorimetric or spectroscopic readout (Fig. 3b)35,46 are different

to those of an end-to-end autonomous robotic experimentation plat-
form working under an inert atmosphere for the co-design of clean
energy materials and devices (Fig. 3c). The hardware and software
modularization and standardization of SDLs, along with providing
open-access communication protocols with different characterization
instrumentations for in situ or online product analysis, can reduce the
development timeframe of SDLs from 1–2 years to 1–2 months.

Successful examples of SDLs
Over  the  past  five  years,  proof-of-concept  SDLs—for  example,
Chemputer13,20,  BEAR36,47,  CAMEO28  and  Artificial  Chemist22,23—
were  successfully  utilized  for  the  autonomous  synthesis  of
nanoparticles22–27,32,34,  polymers48  and  copolymers49,  thin-film
materials29,50,51, carbon nanotubes52, supramolecular clusters53, com-
plex organic molecules13,19,20,54, photocatalysts21 and shape-memory
materials28 for applications in additive manufacturing36, liquid product
formulations55,56, pharmaceuticals57 and clean energy technologies58–60.
Figure 4 shows three approaches to the hardware and robotic integra-
tion of SDLs: portable robotic arms that access an entire SDL (Fig. 4a)21
or connect different modules of SDLs61, stationary robots that supply
manufactured parts36, collected nanomaterial inks26 or thin film sub-
strates (Fig. 4b)29,30 to different SDL modules, and compact workstations
for tube and/or pump-based reagent transfer between the synthesis
and characterization modules of SDLs (Fig. 4c)13,62. The unique aspect
of mobile robots (Fig. 4a) is the facile access to conventional char-
acterization techniques available in a chemical lab without the need

for a direct integration with the synthesis module of SDLs. Despite
this advantage, the high cost of mobile robots that offer a precise and
reproducible sample transfer with multiple grippers poses a major
bottleneck for such SDLs.

Figure 5 shows examples of parallel batch (Fig. 5a)25 and flow reac-
tors (Fig. 5b)22–24,26,34 utilized to automatically perform reactions in
SDLs. In the case of organic or nanomaterial synthesis with no solid
reagent or precipitation during the synthesis, flow reactors provide
an excellent opportunity for reaction miniaturization, reduced chemi-
cal consumption and waste generation, facile integration with online
characterization techniques and access to synthesis conditions, for
example, mixing and heating or cooling rates that are not accessible
to batch reactors19,22–24,32,63. These advantages of flow reactors make
them a promising candidate to access unexplored regions of the design
spaces for emerging molecules and (nano)materials. For solid-phase
synthesis and processing (for example, preparation of thin films, bat-
tery materials or solid-state polymerization), or reactions with the
precipitation of solid products or by-products, parallel batch reactors
are more suitable reactor candidates for SDLs.

From the characterization perspective, both online and offline
modules, such as custom-developed spectroscopy techniques22–24,32,34
and imaging tools29,30, and off-the-shelf analytical units, for example,
high-performance liquid chromatography, Fourier-transform infrared
spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy and gas chromatography13,19–21, have
been successfully integrated with SDLs for the autonomous synthesis
and development of functional materials and molecules. Furthermore,
online characterization modules can provide access to measurements
after each stage of multistage syntheses or material fabrication. Such
intermediate-stage information can be leveraged to accelerate a search
through the high-dimensional space of multistage processes by the
early identification of more advantageous synthetic routes. The inte-
gration of SDLs with online characterization techniques leverages
the extensive hardware development and online reaction sampling
techniques developed during the past two decades via the emergence
and growth of lab-on-a-chip technologies. In addition to common
spectral characterization techniques, the structural characterization
of fabricated (nano)materials using electron microscopy (transmis-
sion electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy) and
small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering can also be integrated with
SDLs; however, the high capital cost and the need for additional com-
plex hardware development and integration limit their integration
with SDLs to specially dedicated facilities. From the ML perspective,
a range of strategies suitable for handling continuous and discrete
parameters, from Bayesian optimization to evolutionary algorithms
(for example, covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy and
genetic algorithms) have been successfully implemented in SDLs for
the accelerated development and on-demand synthesis of organic
molecules, nanomaterials and thin-film materials. For details of differ-
ent ML algorithms utilized in SDLs relevant to chemical and materials
sciences, we refer the reader to recent comprehensive reviews of such
algorithms40,64–68.

Current limitations and future opportunities of
SDLs
Despite successful proof-of-concept examples of SDLs in the acceler-
ated synthesis of complex organic molecules and advanced (nano)mate-
rials, many opportunities exist for further research and development.
First and foremost, for non-experts in autonomous robotic experimen-
tation, the transition of SDLs from sophisticated custom-developed
technologies to a mainstream approach in experimental chemical and
materials sciences requires major advances in hardware development,
which include module engineering and online characterization tech-
niques to reduce the entry barriers, such as cost, module assembly,
operation and troubleshooting. The high cost of robots and charac-
terization modules, the complicated assembly of custom-developed

modules and extensive troubleshooting, all combined with the lack of
standardization of hardware modules, data flow, data representation
and intelligent experiment-selection algorithms, are the current major
limitations of SDLs. We see the initial cost barrier of SDLs as an ena-
bling opportunity for the research acceleration community in chemical
and materials sciences. The large capital expenditure of current SDLs
provides a unique opportunity for researchers interested in hardware
development to focus on low-cost and open-source SDL modules, such
as liquid-handling robots69, syringe pumps70, three-dimensional-printed
reactionware71 and field-deployable diagnostics72. Moreover, the recent
growth of cloud labs around the world73 provides another potential
avenue for early career researchers to access state-of-the-art robotic
experimentation facilities without major capital investments.

The adoption of SDLs by scientists across chemical and materi-
als sciences would entail a highly intelligent and flexible automation
of research labs with autonomously reconfigurable experimental
modules. The challenge of the autonomous development of advanced
functional materials, in contrast to that of small molecules, is the lack
of reproducible data in the literature. Although automated data extrac-
tion from the literature, despite a proved bias74, has been achieved for
organic synthesis19,75 and successfully enabled data-driven retrosyn-
thesis or highly accurate reaction prediction, it has largely failed for
advanced (nano)materials. This failure, however, creates a unique
opportunity for SDLs. The sparse data availability for advanced (nano)
materials (for example, clean energy materials), in combination with
their lab-to-lab variations, makes SDLs an ideal research platform to
provide reproducible data for ML modelling and design space naviga-
tion and for knowledge transfer within each class of targeted mate-
rial. In general, SDLs improve the experimental data reproducibility
through digitization, enhanced accuracy, transferrable knowledge
and minimization of the impact of human errors.

Although mobile or stationary robotic arms can be utilized for
the transfer of liquid-phase reagents or products between different
modules or the automatic reconfiguration of SDLs, they are mostly
required for SDLs that handle solid-phase reagents, or in cases for
which more powerful characterization techniques, for example, NMR
spectroscopy, are required. A critical requirement of SDLs working with
solid-phase reactions, reagents or samples is the need to use robotics

for precise solid-powder dosing and a fast and reliable sample transfer
between different SDL modules. Despite the rapid progress of robots
and solid-dispensing technologies over the past two decades, the high
cost of precise solid-dispensing and robotic arms, with the required
precision, reproducibility, mobility and speed, poses a limitation for
the widespread implementation of SDLs. Reductions in the costs of
solid- and/or liquid-dispensing and stationary and/or mobile robots are
enabling factors for the broad deployment and adoption of SDLs across
chemical and materials sciences. We believe that a critical next step
for SDL adoption is the development of cost-effective mobile robotic
manipulators designed to enable flexibility in the automatic recon-
figuration of the SDL design and adaptation to dynamic changes in the
workspace. Furthermore, robotic manipulators should provide precise
and reproducible high-speed operations to maximize the reproducibil-
ity and agility of SDLs. A reduced cost of mobile robotic manipulators
would enable the incorporation of multiple robots in the SDLs, which
would prevent disruption in the closed-loop SDL operation in the case
of a potential failure of a specific robot. Such open-access and mobile
robotic manipulators will be able to make agile actions in an environ-
ment, similar to conventional human-centred research labs, without the
need for a special lab space design or modification of the SDL operation.
An important software aspect of SDLs is their robust and flexible
integration with ML to provide autonomy for navigation through the
design space of molecules and materials. The rapidly growing list of
ML modelling and experiment selection strategies makes the algo-
rithm selection a challenging task for non-experts. This challenge is
an exciting opportunity for the future development of SDLs towards
the standardization of ML algorithms suitable for different end-to-end
experimental workflows, operation modes (exploration, exploitation
or mechanistic studies) and targeted classes of molecules or (nano)
materials (for example, prior knowledge versus physics-based models
versus black-box search).

Industry plays an important role in addressing the hardware and
software challenges for SDLs by leveraging the prior advancements in
the development of experimental tools for combinatorial screening
applications in medicinal chemistry and molecular biology. By focus-
ing on cost reduction and the standardization of robots, experimental
modules and characterization techniques for SDLs, industry can reduce

and equipment communication protocols are a critically important
advancement for future SDLs39,76. The main pieces of equipment for
the online or in situ characterization of materials or molecules using
conventional spectroscopy and chromatography techniques already
exist. However, SDLs generally need to use custom-built hardware (for
example, a flow cell for the in situ monitoring of reactions performed
in a flow reactor) or a triggering method (for example, online gas chro-
matography sampling) to integrate the existing characterization units
with other SDL modules. As the number of SDL users increases, it is
expected the companies that manufacture characterization instru-
mentation, such as spectrometers and chromatographs, as well as NMR
spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and X-ray diffraction equipment,
will focus on the design and development of sampling and integra-
tion modules with open-access software for the in situ and online
characterization of materials and molecules. In addition, the leading
SDL research groups around the world are strongly encouraged to
work with instrumentation companies to expand the available in situ
and online characterization modules. A successful example of such an
academia–industry collaboration in the advancements of online reac-
tion monitoring modules is the powerful ReactIR probe for integration
with flow reactors developed by Mettler Toledo in collaboration with
the Ley group at the University of Cambridge77.

We encourage the ML community in chemical and materials
sciences to focus their future efforts on the facile benchmarking of
application-specific algorithms45, expanding open-access databases
and making the design space exploration and/or exploitation software
user-friendly. Another important aspect of SDLs that is still not well
studied is how to carefully choose the best ML algorithm to gener-
ate new fundamental knowledge about an underlying phenomenon
or an unexpected relationship between input parameters and out-
put properties for the class of reactions or materials explored by the
SDL. As the number of experimental modules and independent input
parameters of SDLs increases over the next few years, more data- and/
or physics-informed ML strategies will be needed to reduce the total
cost of computation and experimentation to discover new materials
and molecules or the sustainable way to manufacture them at scale78–80.
Such information can be provided to the SDL either from open-source
reaction databases81, or by ML models that are created using prior data
generated by the same or another SDL (for example, the model built on
a different subset of materials or reactions from the same general class
of materials or reactions)82. Data- and/or physics-informed autono-
mous experimentation is a necessary next step of the SDL’s software
development to realize their largest impact in the autonomous dis-
covery of materials and molecules. This aspect of future SDLs requires
cross-disciplinary training83 and collaboration between the ML and
chemical and materials science communities to enable implementation
of the most suitable ML algorithms that are accessible and understand-
able to non-experts. Such collaborations are necessary to accelerate the
intelligent search through the chemical space with constrains, metrics
and objectives defined by domain experts.

One of the most intriguing aspects of SDLs, which is largely unex-
plored and directly tied to the future hardware and software advance-
ments, is their remote operation capabilities through the cloud or
remote connection to define the next goal of the SDL operation27. Auto-
matic access to a library of starting reagents, in combination with reli-
able and reproducible automated sample preparation, synthesis and
online and offline characterization techniques substantially reduces
the required amount of ‘in-person’ presence of the researcher in the
lab during the SDL operations. Furthermore, the remote operation of
SDLs in different physical locations provides the unique advantage of
reproducible knowledge-sharing (data fusion) opportunities via open
databases for different classes of emerging materials and molecules.
We note that the remote operation of SDLs will require differ-
ent workforce training than that of the current paradigm in chemical

and material sciences. The rapidly emerging remote connectivity
tools, such as virtual reality84 and augmented reality85, along with
digital communication platforms provided stimulating avenues to
explore for future SDLs and workforce development during the pan-
demic and continued thereafter. As SDLs start to penetrate different
applications of experimental sciences, one of the major challenges
in the next decade will be the required talent pool of a new genera-
tion of interdisciplinary trained scientists to utilize SDLs to their full
potentials. The need for this new generation of scientists will require
us to re-evaluate our student’s training and focus on multidisciplinary
skills in academia.
